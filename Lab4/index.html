                    <h2>Welcome to Willow's!</h2>
                    <p>Willow's bake shop has been proudly making cakes since 2003! Inspired by a passion for baking, CEO Lilly "Willow" Erikson started her journey from her friend's appartment in new york! After marrying her college sweetheart and retiring as a school teacher, Lilly decided she wanted to start baking. With a loan from a friend, she opened Willow's bake shop. She decided to use her middle name, Willow, which she went by in highschool. Thus, Willow's bake shop was founded.</p>
