            <h2>Welcome to Widgets and Things!</h2>
            <p>Widgets and Things is a brand that strives to bring you the best products possible! We care, unlike most other brands that will never care about you! When these products break, we will respond by telling you that you suck! Because the damage is always your fault, the warrenty that we made you buy is invailid! We sell phones, plants, and a bunch of other junk! If you buy more than one product from us, we will up the shipping cost for absolutely no reason!</p>

            <p> We promise that we will give you the best product possible with the materials you have paid for! When you only pay 10 dollars for a new computer, you need to expect a doll sized laptop that does not work! (I sincearly hope this bit of fun does not impact my grade at all!) </p>
