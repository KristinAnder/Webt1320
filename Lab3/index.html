                    <h2>Sims 4</h2>
                    <p>I love The Sims 4. According to my computer, I have spent over 300 hours on the game, just on this computer alone. Which i just bought a couple years ago. The game has a lot to offer with the young adult and adult sims, but there is not much in the way babies, children and elders. I like the game, but it is not my favorite of the latest 3 games in the franchise.</p>

                    <h2>Sims 3</h2>
                    <p>The Sims 3 is my favorite of the 3. I love all of the options you have with every age of character. The worlds are also better and more expansive than the ones in 3 or some in 2. I also have a strong nostaligic attachment to the game, so that may influence my desicion.</p>

                    <h2>Sims 2</h2>
                    <p>I have never personally played The Sims 2, but I have seen a couple videos on it and the game seems very fun. It is also extremely laggy and has a lot of screen tearing and graphic issues. But I think one day I will pick it up and play it for myself.</p>
